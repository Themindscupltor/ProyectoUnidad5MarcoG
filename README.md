# RECONSTRUCCIÓN FILOGENÉTICA DE ASTYANAX MEXICANUS.


## INTRODUCTION.

*Astyanax mexicanus*, is notable for developing characters related to life in caves, such as eye loss and pigmentation, through a process of regressive evolution (Jeffery, 2009; Herman et al, 2018). The troglobial species of Astyanax mexicanus have become a central model for understanding the evolution of various ontogenetic, physiological and behavioral characters (Keene et al, 2015). The loss of traits is a commonly observed evolutionary pattern in cave organisms, but due to extensive morphological convergence, inferring relationships between cave and surface populations can be difficult. For instance, *Astyanax mexicanus* (the blind Mexican cavefish) is thought to have repeatedly lost its eyes following colonization of cave environments, but the number of evolutionarily independent invasions of this species into caves remains unclear (Coghill *et al*., 2014).

Using RAD SEQ raw data generated inCoghill et al. (2014) ("Next generation phylogeography of cave and surface Astyanax mexicanus")i will try to ese the iPyRAD package to make a *de novo assembly* of the loci. Once assembled, a fraction of the RAD Loci obtained will be use to do a phylogenetic reconstruction using RAXML V8.2.10 and compare the topologies. 

## work organization.

This repository it's organized in the next way:

`Bin` Folder: this folder will contain the RAW RADSeq data from Coghill *et al., (2014)
